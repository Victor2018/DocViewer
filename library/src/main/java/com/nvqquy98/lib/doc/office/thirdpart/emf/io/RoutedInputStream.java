/**
 * The RoutedInputStream allows the user to add a listener for a certain
 * delimited portion of the main inputstream. This portion is marked by a start
 * and end marker. The end marker can be null, in which case the portion runs
 * from the start marker to the end of the main inputstream. The listener is
 * informed via a route (partial inputstream) when input is available. The new
 * routed inputstream (route) is supposed to be read to the end or closed, after
 * which the main inputstream should be read again. Closing a route will not
 * close the original stream, but will discard any bytes up to and including the
 * end marker. Returning from a route without reading until the end of the route
 * means that the remaining bytes are still available on the main stream.
 * Multiple routes can be added, as long as they have different start sequences.
 * Start sequences such as "StartA, StartB, StartEmpty" are allowed, but
 * "Start, StartOther" are not since they overlap. Start and End markers can be
 * the same.
